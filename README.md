# Decision-Tree-Regression

Decision Tree is a powerful method in Machine Learning which is used both for regression and classification models. A decision tree is a flow-chart-like structure, where each internal (non-leaf) node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of a test, and each leaf (or terminal) node holds a class label. The outcome of the test is based on the previous conditions.

It splits the dataset in some specific sub-parts based on the inputs given and calculates the mean and assign the each class selected the mean value.

Requirements for implementation of decision Tree Regression in python:-

The following should be installed. 1.Numpy 2.Pandas 3.Matplotlib 4.sklearn

The exact splitting of the dataset is attached in the file(splitting.png). Position_salaries.csv is the datafile containing the data of employees of a company. The above model predicts the salaries of employees having a certain position in the company.

Run the .ipynb file in jupyter notebook to see the results of the model. The original.png contains the plot of position vs salaries. The results.png contains the plot of position vs salaries after applying the DTR model.


Those who want to learn and understand Practically of DecisionTree that time this repo will be very helpfull of them.
